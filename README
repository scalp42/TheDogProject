The DOG Project Website
-----------------------

As a Freelance Software developer whose concern is mostly Web development, 
I need a nice little website which would showcase my many talents and act
as a portfolio to show potential clients.

Why not use some already available CMS and write templates for it? 

Because I want to learn Ruby on Rails.
So in addition to being my awesome little HTML5 extravaganza, this would become
my Ruby on Rails Introduction course.

DOG?
 
 Yup DOG. Don't know what its an acronym of yet, but it's mostly because I'm
nicodoggie.
